# Kvass

  [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/tkestack/kvass)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/tkestack/kvass)      [![Build](https://github.com/tkestack/kvass/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)]()      [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tkestack/kvass/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/tkestack/kvass)
------

Kvass provides a method of Prometheus sharding, which uses config file injection to proxy Prometheus scraping to the shard sidecar, and the shard sidecar decides whether to scrape target。

A coordinator manage all shards  and assigned targets to each of them。

Thanos (or other storage solution) is used to provide a global data view。

------

## Feature

* Tens of millions series supported (thousands of k8s nodes)
* One configuration file
* Dynamic scaling
* Sharding according to the actual target load instead of label hash
* multiple replicas supported

## Quick start 

clone kvass to local 

> git clone https://github.com/tkestack.io/kvass

install example (just an example with testing metrics)

> Kubectl create -f ./examples

you can found a Deployment named "metrics" with 6 Pod, each Pod will generate 10045 series (45 series from golang default metrics) metircs。

we will scrape metrics from them。

the max series each Prometheus Shard can scape is defined as an argurment in Coordinator Pod.

in the example case we set to 22000.

> ```
> --max-series=22000
> ```

now we have 6 target with 60270 series  (270 series from golang default metrics)  and each Shard can scrape 22000 series，so we beed 3 Shard to cover all targets.

now Coordinator  automaticly change replicate of Prometheus Statefulset to 3 and assign targets to them.

only 20120 series in prometheus_tsdb_head of one Shard

![image-20200917112924277](./README.assets/image-20200917112924277.png)

but we can get global data view use thanos-query

## Multiple replicas

Coordinator use label selector to select shards StatefulSets, every StatefulSet is a replica, Kvass puts together Pods with same index of different StatefulSet into one Shards Group.

> --sts-selector=app.kubernetes.io/name=prometheus

## Build binary

> git clone https://github.com/tkestack.io/kvass
>
> cd kvass
>
> make
